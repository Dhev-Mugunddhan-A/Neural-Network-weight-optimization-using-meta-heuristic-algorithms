# Neural-Network-weight-optimization-using-meta-heuristic-algorithms
This project focuses on **optimizing the weights of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to enhance its performance on a **classification problem**. The core methodology involves applying and comparing three different **meta-heuristic algorithms**:

* **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):** This algorithm is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It uses a "pheromone" trail to find the optimal path, which in this context, represents the best set of weights for the neural network.
* **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** Modeled after the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling, this method uses a swarm of "particles" to explore the solution space. Each particle adjusts its position based on its own best-known position and the best-known position of the entire swarm, iteratively converging on an optimal solution for the weights.
* **Genetic Algorithm (GA):** This algorithm mimics the process of natural selection. It evolves a population of potential solutions (neural network weight sets) through processes like selection, crossover, and mutation to find the fittest solution, which corresponds to the most effective set of weights.

The goal is to analyze which of these nature-inspired optimization techniques yields the most accurate and efficient neural network for the given classification task.
